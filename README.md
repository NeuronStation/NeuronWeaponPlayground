# NeuronWeaponPlayground

This is a work in progress implementation of a weapon system and a special weapon called smart weapon. The smart weapon resemble the Kang Tao "Type 41" weapon of Cyberpunk 2077 (https://youtu.be/6wI5xPae8Eo?t=2429).

The code is full of the label with the name [NWP-REVIEW]. That label indicates code areas which should be improved. Also, they are notes about implementation details. This project is based on the Unreal's C++ FPS template. Some part of the original FPS template code still exists. That code should fit the project code style guide or be deleted if necessary.

The code style guide is the one indicated in the file TemplateClass.h & TemplateClass.cpp.

The most interesting classes are the following: ANWPWeapon, ANWPSmartWeapon, UNWPWeaponConfig, UNWPSmartWeaponConfig, ANWPProjectile, UNWPProjectileMovementComponent and ANWPHUD.

Please if you want to check code, check the code associated to a version tag because it is more stable and presentable.

The following link is a folder with version builds and videos. It is very interesting if you want to take a quick look at the state of the project: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VhkRTsbsWl7Dv2vc6cWGULtwSWDGhCOK
